## Ingredients

For 4 people. For the chicken curry:

- 500gr chicken mini breast fillets
- 1 grated onion
- 1-2 tbsp curry powder
- 1 grated apple (rather sour & juicy, e.g., Boskoop, Granny Smith)
- 2dl single cream 
- 1 cube of chicken stock in 1dl of water
- flour, butter, salt, oil (e.g. light olive oil)

On the side:

- Basmati rice
- tomatoes (peeled and diced, with salt & possibly cilantro)
- kiwi
- ananas
- banana (cut in two & slowly cooked with butter in a pan with a lid)
- peanuts


## Instructions

1. Dice the chicken (no need to dice too small), and mix in a plate with two
   coffee spoons of flour.
2. Brown ("rissoler") the chicken with oil in a pan. Once ready, remove the
   chicken, but leave the oil in the pan.
3. Saut√© the oignon and the curry powder, and add the grated apple. Let the
   juice evaporate a little.
4. Mix in the chicken stock and the cream.
5. Add the chicken back into the pan, let it simmer with the lid for a while.


## Notes

- In Switzerland: best results with "Curry Mild" from McCormick (available at
  Coop).
- Chicken breast fillets can be frozen.
- Works best when apple is grated quite finely.
