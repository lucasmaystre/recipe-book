## Ingredients

For 4 people.

- 250gr Arborio rice
- ~4x volume of rice in vegetable / chicken stock
- 150-200gr varied mushrooms (shiitake, oyster, ...)
- shallots, scallions, onions
- garlic
- 1dl dry white wine
- olive oil
- butter
- parmigiano
- salt / pepper
- thyme


## Instructions

Important: be patient, it takes time.

1.  Heat stock in a pot, bring just below boiling point.
2.  In parallel, heat olive oil in a big pot (remember that rice will double in
    size).
3.  Add shallots (or scallions, onions, ...) and then garlic. Cook until
    translucent.
4.  Add butter and mushrooms, cook until soft and tender. Takes a while.
5.  Add thyme, pepper.
6.  Add rice, turn until fully coated in mushrooms. Should be "toasted". Takes
    1-2 min.
7.  Add the wine. Wait until it is cooked off.
8.  Start adding the stock. Always add just enough so that it covers the rice.
    Patience is key. Stir continuously in circular motion. Continue adding bit
    by bit. Should take ~20 minutes. When pulling spoon through risotto, rice
    should slowly "ooze" back in place. Then you know you're done.
9.  Mix in grated parmigiano.
10. Serve with some fresh parmigiano on top, and optionally some parsley.
