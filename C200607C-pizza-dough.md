## Ingredients

For 3-4 pizzas.

- 650gr white flour (preferably *strong* or '00')
- 7gr (~3 tsp) dried easy-blend yeast
- 2 tsp salt
- 25ml (2 small tbsp) olive oil
- 325ml warm water
- 50ml warm milk


## Instructions

1. Mix the flour, yeast and salt.
2. Stir in the olive oil and the milk.
3. Gradually add the water (you might want to put more or less water, and
   simply stop when the dough feels "right").
4. Knead for about 5 minutes.
5. Cover with a damp teatowel and leave to rise for 1.5 hours, until doubled in
   size.
6. Knock the dough back, then knead again until smooth, roll into a ball and
   set aside 30 min. to 1 hour.
7. The pizza will then cook in 10-15 min at 250 C.


## Notes

- Dough can be kept in the fridge for a while. watch out for the fact that it
  might rise in the fridge.
- It really is helpful if the water / milk is warm. Otherwise it will have
  trouble rising.
- One trick that can be helpful in the winter is to put the dough to rise in
  the oven, pre-heated at ~40-50 C.
