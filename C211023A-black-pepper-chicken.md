## Ingredients

For 4 portions.

- 500 gr chicken breast
- 1 bell pepper (preferably red)
- 1 red onion
- 2 stalks celery
- 2 cloves garlic
- 4 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp oyster sauce
- 1 tbsp rice wine vinegar
- 1 tsp flour / cornstarch
- 1 tsp freshly-cracked black pepper
- 1 tsp fresh ground ginger (or 1/4 if dry powder)
- mild-flavored oil
- optional: green onions, sesame seeds


## Instructions

1. Cut the bell pepper and celery stalks in very thin slices. Dice the onion.
   Dice the chicken into small cubes.
2. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a pan, sauté the chicken until cooked through. Use a
   slotted spoon to transfer it to a plate and set aside.
3. Add 1 tbsp oil, and sauté the bell pepper, onion, celery. Press the garlic,
   and cook for 5-6 minutes.
4. In the meantime, combine the soy sauce, oyster sauce, vinegar, flour, black
   pepper and ginger in a small bowl.
5. Once the veggies are ready, add the chicken and the sauce, stil until the
   veggies and chicken are evenly coated. Continue to cook for 1-2 minutes
   until the sauce has thickened.
6. Sprinkle with toppings (green onions, sesame seeds) if desired, and serve
   immediately.


## Notes

- The oyster sauce really brings a lot. I tried once without (2022-03-28) and
  it was not nearly as good.
