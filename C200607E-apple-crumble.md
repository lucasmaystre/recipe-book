## Ingredients

- 4 big apples
- 60 + 30-40 gr sugar
- 185 gr flour
- 120 gr melted butter
- cinnamon powder


## Instructions

1. Put a bit of butter in a dish that will go in the oven.
2. Peel and dice the apples and put them in the dish.
3. In a bowl, put the flour, the butter, 40gr of sugar and 1 coffee spoon of
   cinnamon powder. Mix with the hands until you obtain crumble.
4. Pre-heat the oven at 200 C (top & bottom). Put a bit of cinnamon powder and
   the remainder of the sugar on the apples.
5. Add the crumble on top of the apples. Cook in the oven for 25 minutes.


## Notes

- It is important that there be enough butter in the crumble mix (better too
  much than not enough). Otherwise the result will be too "sandy".
- Juicy, tarty cooking apples work best.
