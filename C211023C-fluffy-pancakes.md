## Ingredients

For a decent-sized breakfast for 2 people.

- 145 g plain flour
- 10 g sugar
- 2 tsp baking powder (NOT baking soda!)
- a pinch of salt
- 220 ml milk
- 30 g butter
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 small egg


## Instructions

1. Melt the butter, set aside and let it cool a little bit.
2. Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a bowl. Mix together.
3. Whisk the egg, add in the milk, vanilla extract and butter. Mix well.
4. Make a well in the center of the bowl with the flour, and pour in the
   liquids. Mix together gently. Add a bit of flour or milk to reach a thick
   consistency
5. Heat a bit of butter in a pan. Add in some of the batter. When the underside
   is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the surface, flip with a spatula.


## Notes

- Can add blueberries in the batter.
- Serve with honey, maple syrup, fruit, or enjoy plain.
