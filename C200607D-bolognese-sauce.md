- Italian herbs, bay leaf


## Instructions

1. Cook the onions, then add the minced beef ("faire revenir").
2. Add in the carrots and the celery and cook them.
3. Add the stock cubes (try to break them so that they season the whole dish),
   salt if needed, and italian herbs.
4. Add two coffee spoons of flour, mix well.
5. If available, add in the red wine.
6. Add the tomatoes (first fresh then those in a can), a bay leaf, and the
   tomato paste.

Verify that the seasoning is to taste and / or if more liquid or tomatoes are
needed.
