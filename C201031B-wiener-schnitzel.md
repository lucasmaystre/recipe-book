## Ingredients

For 4 portions.

- 600 gr veal escalopes
- 1 egg
- 120 gr breadcrumbs

- paprika, salt, pepper
- clarified butter (or cooking oil)


## Instructions

1. Soften the escalopes by beating them with a hammer. Season the meat with
   salt, pepper and paprika.
2. Prepare three plates:
    - one with flour
    - one with the egg (beaten)
    - one with the breadcrumbs
   Pass the escalopes first in the flour, then in the egg, then in the
   breadcrumbs. Press well.
3. Heat the clarified butter in a pan. Fry the the escalopes 2 min on each face

## Notes

  at 60 degrees with the door slightly open (use a wooden spatula to keep it
  open).
