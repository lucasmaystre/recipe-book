## Ingredients

For 4 portions.

- 3 tbsp butter 
- 2 eggs, whisked
- 2 medium carrots, diced
- 1 small onion, diced
- 1/2 cup frozen peas
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- ~250 gr cooked basmati rice, chilled
- 3-4 tbsp soy sauce
- 3 green onions, sliced
- 1-2 tsp toasted sesame oil


## Instructions

1. Heat 1/2 tbsp butter in a pan, and scramble the eggs (not too much). Set
   aside in a bowl.
2. Add 1 tbsp of butter. Sauté the onions, carrots, peas, garlic for about 5
   min, until soft. Season with some salt and pepper.
3. Put the veggies to the side, melt the remaining 1.5 tbsp of butter. Increase
   the heat, and add in the rice, soy sauce and green onions. Mix together,
   stir frequently until it starts to brown (~3 min).
4. Remove from heat, and stir in the sesame oil and the scrambled eggs. Add
   salt, pepper and soy sauce, if needed.


## Notes

- Important to use *cold* rice. Prepare day before.
- Can add a protein as well, e.g., chicken, minced beef, shrimps. Sauté
  separately.
