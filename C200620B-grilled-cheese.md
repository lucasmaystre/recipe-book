## Ingredients

Here is a set of ingredients that worked for me (for 2 people).

- 8 slices of white bread
- 150 gr of mild cheddar
- 80gr ham
- butter


## Instructions

1. Grate the cheese coarsely.
2. Butter one side of each bread slice. Divide the cheese across slices, put on
   top the non-buttered side. Add a piece of ham on every second slice.
3. Start heating a cast iron skillet. Once hot, put in two slices of bread,
   buttered-side down. Cover the skillet (e.g., with a silicone lid).
4. After ~2 min, once the cheese start melting, put the slices on top of each
   other. Finish grilling each side of the sandwich for ~30 sec.
5. Repeat with the remaining sandwiches.
